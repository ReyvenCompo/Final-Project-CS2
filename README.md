Project Summary

The E-Shop Analyzer is a Python-based, menu-driven application designed to analyze e-commerce order data stored in a JSON file. The program automatically processes raw transaction data and generates useful summaries such as total sales, top-selling products, category-based reports, pending orders, and customer-specific purchase details.

By using Python file handling and data processing techniques, the project transforms complex JSON data into readable and organized information. This system improves efficiency by reducing the need for manual data analysis and demonstrates the practical application of Python programming concepts in real-world e-commerce scenarios.
